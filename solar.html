            <p>This project entailed the creation of a bespoke website for a solar cell company. The objective was to gain experience in collaborating with a business and developing a website that effectively drives sales. I was responsible for all aspects of the project, such as design, content creation and hosting. I also report to the busniess about the analytics of the site. The website was built using WordPress.</p>
